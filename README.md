# Taisa

> "I wish I could shadow a senior version of myself while I work."

A personal AI career companion that lives close to your work life. Capture what's happening day-to-day, get coached by a senior version of yourself, and have polished outputs (CV bullets, quarterly reviews) ready when you need them.

Built for one person first — the builder. Validated by real use before expanding.

## What It Does

```
You log what happened at work (voice or text)
  ↓
Claude analyses it as a senior career coach
  ↓
Wins, challenges, action items, and CV moments are captured
  ↓
When you need a quarterly review or CV update,
the material is already shaped and waiting
```

| State | Zustand |

## Running Locally

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for first-time setup (API keys, environment files).

**Common issue:** If port 3001 is in use by another local dev server, change `PORT` in `backend/.env` and update `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `mobile/.env` to match.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (from repo root)
npm run backend

# Terminal 2 — mobile (from repo root)
npm run mobile
```

Your Mac's local IP (needed for `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `mobile/.env`):
```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

## Product Vision

See [docs/product/01-product/product-brief-001.docx](docs/product/01-product/product-brief-001.docx) for the full product brief.

The problem is a chain — memory gap → lost context → missing guidance → navigating career growth alone with incomplete information. Taisa closes the loop.
