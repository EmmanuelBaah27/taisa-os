# Taisa — Claude Code Context

Taisa is a personal AI career companion for a solo designer (Baah). Users log daily work via voice; Claude analyses it as a senior career coach, extracts wins/challenges/action items, and surfaces CV-worthy moments. The v1 loop is fully functional. The next major build is the chat interface + four-mode Senior Self agent.

**Stack:** React Native/Expo + NativeWind, Node/Express, SQLite, Anthropic SDK (claude-sonnet-4-6), OpenAI Whisper.

## Critical Constraints

Do not violate these without explicit instruction:

- **No auth in v1** — `userId` = device UUID, passed via `x-user-id` header. Set automatically in `mobile/src/services/api.ts` via Axios interceptor reading from expo-secure-store. Do not add auth middleware.
- **SQLite only** — `backend/src/db/connection.ts`. No migrations system. Add columns via `ALTER TABLE` or update `schema.sql` and note manual migration needed.
- **Expo managed workflow** — do not run `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo eject` unless explicitly asked. Use `npx expo start`.
- **`mobile/` is NOT in root workspace** — it has its own `node_modules`. Run `npm install` inside `mobile/` for mobile deps. Never `npm install` from root for mobile packages. Root workspace: `["backend", "shared"]` only.
- **NativeWind for all new UI** — no `StyleSheet.create()` in new or rebuilt components. See `docs/design-system.md`.

## The Critical Gap

**Product docs describe a chat interface with four coaching modes (Mirror / Nudge / Challenge / Direct). What's built is a voice journaling loop with one-shot Claude analysis. Do not conflate them.**

The Senior Self persona is NOT yet implemented. The current `journalProcessor.ts` is a structured analyser. The build guide for closing this gap is in `docs/agent-persona.md` Part 3.

## Backend Pattern

Every AI feature: route → agent → prompt builder → `callClaudeJson` → DB write.
Reference: `backend/src/services/claude/journalAgent.ts` + `backend/src/prompts/system/journalProcessor.ts`.
Full walkthrough: `docs/architecture.md` § "How the Backend Calls Claude".

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start backend (from repo root)
npm run backend

# Start mobile (from repo root)
npm run mobile

# Install a mobile dependency
cd mobile && npm install <package>

# Install a backend dependency
npm install <package> --workspace=backend
```
