## Memory Model Mapping

The product spec (artifact #003) defines six memory entities. Here's how they map to the actual DB:

| Product entity | DB table(s) | Status | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Goal | `goals` | ✅ Direct match | — |
| Log Entry | `journal_entries` | ✅ Voice/text, richer than spec'd | — |
| CV Moment | `action_items` (high priority, open) | ⚠️ Approximated | No dedicated CV archive; no draft bullet generation |
| Insight | `entry_analyses.coach_note` | ⚠️ Partial | Per-session only; not aggregated across sessions |
| Pattern | `career_themes` + `trajectory_snapshots` | ⚠️ Partial | Themes tracked, but not surfaced as named patterns |
| Open Thread | `action_items` (open status) | ⚠️ Approximated | Not a first-class entity; no explicit "thread" concept |

**The three memory layers** (Immediate / Recent / Persistent) from artifact #003 are **not implemented** as distinct DB structures. All data lives in the same SQLite file. This is the primary architectural gap to close when building the chat interface. See `docs/agent-persona.md`.

## How Context Gets Injected Into Claude

Before every `callClaudeJson` call, `journalAgent.ts` loads:

```
entry           → the journal_entries row being analysed
profile         → user role, company, coaching style, goals text, current_focus_area
open_items      → action_items with status = 'open' (most recent first, LIMIT 10)
themes          → career_themes ordered by count DESC (LIMIT 20)
active_goals    → goals with status = 'active', including milestones (no LIMIT — all active goals loaded)
```

This context is formatted into the prompt by the prompt builder functions in `backend/src/prompts/system/journalProcessor.ts`. The agent does not load prior session transcripts or analyses — only the aggregated artifacts (themes, goals, open items).
