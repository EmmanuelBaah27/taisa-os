## Part 1 — What the Product Spec Says

The agent is "The Senior Self" — a version of Baah that has already become what Baah is working toward. 8–10 years of earned perspective as a senior designer who has navigated the exact transitions Baah is navigating.

It is not a coach, a cheerleader, or a productivity tool. It is a thinking partner with a point of view — one that prioritises Baah's long-term growth over short-term comfort.

### The Four Interaction Modes

Every response falls into exactly one mode. The mode is chosen by the agent based on what the situation calls for — not habit or default.

**Mode 1 — Mirror**
Fires when: Baah shares something and there is no material gap or risk to surface. Also fires for genuine, specific acknowledgment when something is done well.
- ✅ Confirm input received, reflect back without editorialising, one open question max
- ✅ Acknowledge specifically and concretely when something is genuinely strong
- ❌ Insert unprompted guidance, turn acknowledgment into a coaching moment, give empty validation ("great work!" with no basis)

**Mode 2 — Nudge**
Fires when: there is an insight Baah can likely reach himself. Point toward it without stating it.
- ✅ One question pointing toward the insight, a reframe ("another way to look at this"), "there's something in that worth exploring"
- ❌ State the insight directly (that's Challenge), follow up if Baah doesn't engage immediately, frame it as a next step

**Mode 3 — Challenge**
Fires when: there is a pattern, a conflict with stated goals, or a risky assumption Baah won't surface alone — or that carries real cost if left unnamed.
- ✅ State the observation directly, name patterns across entries ("this is the third time"), flag goal conflicts
- ❌ Soften into a question to avoid discomfort, issue multiple challenges, repeat a challenge already acknowledged

**Mode 4 — Direct Response**
Fires when: Baah has explicitly asked "what should I do" or "what do you think." Only this unlocks a full direct answer.
- ✅ Clear specific answer, recommendation with reasoning, honest "not enough context" when true
- ❌ Pad with caveats, give a non-answer, use this mode without an explicit ask

### Hard Limits (All Modes)
- One question per response maximum
- Never default to Challenge — it is earned, not the baseline
- Never validate without a specific basis
- Never repeat a challenge Baah has consciously set aside
- Never end a session without at least a Mirror acknowledgment of what was shared

### What the Agent Tracks Over Time
- Stated goals vs. actual behaviour
- Recurring avoidances or hesitations
- CV-worthy moments from daily work
- Skills being used vs. skills being developed
- Patterns in what Baah notices and what he misses

---

## Part 2 — What's Currently Implemented

The current implementation (`backend/src/prompts/system/journalProcessor.ts`) is a **structured analysis engine**, not the Senior Self persona.

### What it does
- Reads a voice journal transcript and extracts structured data across 13 categories: summary, sentiment, energy level, wins, challenges, decisions, action items, themes, a coach note, growth areas, momentum signal, pattern flags, accountability callouts, and goal assessments
- Assesses the entry against each of the user's active goals and assigns a numeric `progressDelta` (−5 to +20) supported by specific evidence quoted from the transcript
- Surfaces pattern flags: named recurring patterns with a `patternType`, description, and related entry IDs (though related IDs are populated as empty arrays — the engine cannot cross-reference prior entries)
- Writes a 2–3 sentence `coachNote` directly to the user in second person, calibrated to their `accountabilityLevel` (intense vs. gentle) and `coachingStyle` preference
- Applies a `momentumSignal` label — `accelerating`, `steady`, `stalling`, or `recovering` — as a single scalar read on the entry's direction
- Produces accountability callouts: explicit named behaviours where the user fell short of their own commitments, drawn from open action items loaded from prior entries

### What it does NOT do
- Does not select a mode — always responds as a structured analyst regardless of input
- Does not have narrative memory of prior sessions — context is flat aggregates (themes, goals counts), not "last week you said X"
- Does not support back-and-forth conversation — one-shot analysis only; no conversational turn-taking
- Does not implement Mirror — always produces structured output even when nothing notable happened
- Does not track "what Baah keeps avoiding" or "patterns he misses" — only what he explicitly logs

### Current JSON output shape

Claude is instructed to return exactly this structure (field names, types, and meaning):

| Field | Type | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| `summary` | `string` (2–3 sentences) | Plain-language summary of the entry |
| `sentiment` | `"very_positive" \| "positive" \| "neutral" \| "challenging" \| "difficult"` | Overall emotional tone |
| `energyLevel` | `1 \| 2 \| 3 \| 4 \| 5` | Inferred energy/motivation level (1 = depleted, 5 = high) |
| `wins` | `Array<{ title, description, impact: "small"\|"medium"\|"large", category: "technical"\|"leadership"\|"relationship"\|"delivery"\|"learning" }>` | Positive moments worth recording |
| `challenges` | `Array<{ title, description, category, resolution: "unresolved"\|"in_progress"\|"resolved" }>` | Obstacles or difficulties mentioned |
| `decisions` | `Array<{ title, description, decisionMade: string\|null, context: string\|null }>` | Choices faced or made |
| `actionItems` | `Array<{ id: "uuid-placeholder", title, dueContext: string\|null, priority: "high"\|"medium"\|"low", status: "open", sourceEntryId: "entry-id-placeholder" }>` | Commitments surfaced from the entry (IDs are replaced server-side) |
| `themes` | `Array<{ label: string, weight: 0.0–1.0 }>` | Topic labels with relative weight |
| `coachNote` | `string` | 2–3 sentence direct message to the user in second person |
| `growthAreas` | `string[]` | Skills or competencies the entry points to as development opportunities |
| `momentumSignal` | `"accelerating" \| "steady" \| "stalling" \| "recovering"` | Directional read on the user's career trajectory from this entry |
| `patternFlags` | `Array<{ patternType: string, description: string, relatedEntryIds: [] }>` | Named recurring patterns (related entry IDs always empty — no cross-entry lookup) |
| `accountabilityCallouts` | `string[]` | Named instances where the user did not follow through on prior commitments |
| `goalAssessments` | `Array<{ goalId: string, evidence: string, progressDelta: number, milestonesAchieved: [] }>` | Per-goal progress read with numeric delta and evidence quote |

### Current context loaded

`journalAgent.ts` loads the following DB data before calling Claude:

| Source | Table | Columns fetched | Limit / filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Career profile | `users` | All columns (mapped to `CareerProfile` fields: `current_role`, `current_company`, `industry`, `years_of_experience`, `career_stage`, `short_term_goal`, `long_term_goal`, `current_focus_area`, `coaching_style`, `accountability_level`, etc.) | Single row by `user_id` |
| Open action items | `action_items` | `title`, `due_context`, `priority`, `created_at` | `status = 'open'`, ordered by `created_at DESC`, `LIMIT 10` |
| Recent themes | `career_themes` | `label`, `count` | All rows for user, ordered by `count DESC`, `LIMIT 20` |
| Active goals | `goals` | All columns | `status = 'active'` for user |
| Goal milestones | `milestones` | `id`, `title`, `status` | All milestones per active goal (nested query, no limit) |

No prior `entry_analyses` rows (e.g., `coach_note` or `pattern_flags` from earlier sessions) are loaded. The agent has no access to what it said in previous analyses.

## Part 3 — How to Build the Gap

This is the build guide for the AI layer. Work through these steps in order with Claude's assistance. Each step builds on the previous one.

**Recommended build order (prerequisites first):**
1. Step 3 — Conversation Interface (prerequisite for all other steps)
2. Step 5 — Persistent Memory (builds on chat sessions)
3. Step 1 — Mode Selection (add modes once chat exists)
4. Step 2 — Prior Session Context (feeds into mode selection)
5. Step 4 — Session Summary (final polish on session end)

---

### Step 1: Add Mode-Selection Logic to the Prompt

**What to change:** `backend/src/prompts/system/journalProcessor.ts` (or a new `chatProcessor.ts` if chat is on a separate route)

**What to add to the system prompt:**

```
Before responding, assess the situation and select exactly one mode:
- MIRROR: if what was shared has no material gap or risk worth naming right now
- NUDGE: if there is an insight the user can likely reach themselves
- CHALLENGE: if there is a pattern, goal conflict, or risky assumption they won't surface alone
- DIRECT: only if the user explicitly asked "what should I do" or "what do you think"

State the selected mode at the start of your JSON response as: "mode": "Mirror" | "Nudge" | "Challenge" | "Direct"

Mode rules:
- MIRROR: acknowledge and reflect only. One question max. No guidance.
- NUDGE: one question that aims at the insight without stating it. Stay quiet after.
- CHALLENGE: state the observation directly. One challenge only. Explain why it matters.
- DIRECT: give a clear, specific answer. No caveats padding.
```

**What to add to the response JSON shape:** `"mode": "Mirror | Nudge | Challenge | Direct"`

**How to verify it works:** Send a transcript like "Had a good day, team session went well" — should return `"mode": "Mirror"`. Send "I keep saying I'll push for strategy once this project ends" — should return `"mode": "Challenge"`.

---

### Step 2: Inject Prior Session Context as Narrative

**What to change:** `backend/src/services/claude/journalAgent.ts` (or `chatAgent.ts`)

**What to add — load recent coach notes from DB:**

```typescript
const recentAnalyses = db.prepare(`
  SELECT ea.coach_note, ea.pattern_flags, je.recorded_at
  FROM entry_analyses ea
  JOIN journal_entries je ON je.id = ea.entry_id
  WHERE je.user_id = ? AND je.status = 'complete'
  ORDER BY je.recorded_at DESC
  LIMIT 5
`).all(userId);
```

**What to add to the prompt builder — pass recent context:**

```typescript
// Add to buildJournalProcessorSystem() or buildChatProcessorSystem()
const recentContext = recentAnalyses.length > 0
  ? `Recent sessions (last ${recentAnalyses.length}):\n` +
    recentAnalyses.map((a, i) =>
      `[${i + 1}] ${a.recorded_at.slice(0, 10)}: ${a.coach_note}`
    ).join('\n')
  : 'No prior sessions yet.';

// Add to system prompt string:
// `${recentContext}`
```

**Why this matters:** Without prior context, the agent cannot identify "this is the third time you've said this." Pattern recognition requires history.

---

### Step 3: Implement the Conversation Interface

**What this requires — new backend files:**

```
backend/src/routes/chat.ts          POST /api/v1/chat/message
                                     POST /api/v1/chat/session/start
                                     POST /api/v1/chat/session/end
backend/src/services/claude/chatAgent.ts   session state + Claude call
backend/src/prompts/system/chatProcessor.ts  Senior Self system prompt
```

**New DB tables needed:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  started_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  ended_at TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'  -- active / ended
);

CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES chat_sessions(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'user' / 'assistant'
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  mode TEXT,           -- Mirror / Nudge / Challenge / Direct (assistant messages only)
  cv_moment_flagged INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

**New route shapes:**

```typescript
POST /api/v1/chat/session/start
Response: { sessionId: string }

POST /api/v1/chat/message
Body: { sessionId: string, message: string }
Response: { reply: string, mode: "Mirror|Nudge|Challenge|Direct", cvMomentFlagged: boolean }

POST /api/v1/chat/session/end
Body: { sessionId: string }
Response: { summary: { keyMoments: string[], insights: string[], openThreads: string[], cvMoments: string[] } }
```

**Prompt shape for chat — use Anthropic Messages API conversation format:**

```typescript
// chatAgent.ts
const messages = await loadSessionMessages(sessionId); // from chat_messages table
// Pass as alternating user/assistant turns to Anthropic SDK
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: MODEL,
  system: buildChatProcessorSystem(profile, goals, recentContext, patterns),
  messages: [
    ...messages.map(m => ({ role: m.role, content: m.content })),
    { role: 'user', content: newMessage }
  ],
  max_tokens: 1024
});
```

**Note on `callClaudeJson` signature:** The current `client.ts` function accepts `{ system, userMessage, temperature?, maxTokens? }` and supports only a single user message. The chat interface will need to call the Anthropic SDK directly (as shown above) to pass a full `messages` array of alternating turns. `callClaudeJson` is not suitable for multi-turn conversation without modification.

**Mobile changes needed:** New `mobile/app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` screen with messaging UI. Session starts on first message, ends when user taps "End session."

---

### Step 4: Implement the Session Summary

**Fires when:** User taps "End session" — `POST /api/v1/chat/session/end`

**What Claude generates:**

```json
{
  "keyMoments": ["string — what was shared that mattered"],
  "insightsSurfaced": ["string — what the agent noticed"],
  "openThreadsCreated": ["string — unresolved issues to track"],
  "cvMomentsFlagged": ["string — professional bullet drafts"]
}
```

**Prompt for summary generation:**

```typescript
// In chatAgent.ts, on session end:
const allMessages = await loadSessionMessages(sessionId);
const summaryPrompt = `You have just completed a coaching session. 
Review the conversation and extract:
- keyMoments: 2–4 things the user shared that were significant
- insightsSurfaced: observations you made during the session
- openThreadsCreated: issues raised but not resolved
- cvMomentsFlagged: any moments worth adding to a professional CV

Return as JSON matching the schema above.`;

const summary = await callClaudeJson(summaryPrompt, JSON.stringify(allMessages));
```

**Where to store:** Write to `chat_sessions` table (add a `summary` JSON column) or a new `chat_session_summaries` table.

**Mobile:** Show as a full-screen modal after session ends. Allow tap-through to Today or CV Archive.

---

### Step 5: Build the Persistent Memory Layer

**What to add to DB:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN stated_patterns TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]';
-- JSON array of: { label: string, confirmedAt: string, exampleEntryId: string }

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN open_threads TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]';
-- JSON array of: { title: string, createdAt: string, lastReferencedAt: string }

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN memory_last_updated TEXT;
```

**What to change in agents:**

Load `stated_patterns` and `open_threads` from the users table at the start of every chat session. Pass into the system prompt:

```typescript
// In buildChatProcessorSystem():
const patternsContext = statedPatterns.length > 0
  ? `Confirmed patterns about this person:\n${statedPatterns.map(p => `- ${p.label}`).join('\n')}`
  : '';

const threadsContext = openThreads.length > 0
  ? `Open threads (unresolved):\n${openThreads.map(t => `- ${t.title} (${t.lastReferencedAt})`).join('\n')}`
  : '';
```

**When to update:** At session end, include in the summary prompt an instruction to propose updates:

```json
{
  "proposedPatternUpdates": [{ "action": "add|remove", "label": "string" }],
  "proposedThreadUpdates": [{ "action": "add|resolve", "title": "string" }]
}
```

Write accepted updates back to `users.stated_patterns` and `users.open_threads`.
